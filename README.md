# The Affair Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "affairs" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I knew I would need lists of members, affairs, and organizations in order to properly do the assignment. I started with the intention of it being object oriented, but because of my lack
> of familiarity with TypeScript, my main focus just became getting something that works. 


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I used the online TypeScript handbook and googled how to do specific things in TypeScript, such as the indexOf() function.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Somewhere between 10 and 20 hours, but much of that was while slightly groggy and teaching myself TypeScript, and if I had been fully awake or already known how
> to use TypeScript, it probably would have only taken 6 to 8 hours.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 8.5


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I think it would be good if Dr. Church had told us how to export the AffairManager class so that everything linked to the UI he created without us just
> having to try and figure that out. It was the main thing that held me back from progressing on the assignment because I could not figure out why the UI
> couldn't find my manager.js file, and I wrote most of it without being able to test in the UI, leading to more rewriting than I think would have occurred
> if I had known.
